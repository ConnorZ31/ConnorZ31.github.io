        <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
        <p>For me graphic design has always been something I enjoy, but it has never been my main focus. So it has become more of a hobby
            for me. Most of my time working on graphic design is for classes like Image and text. I still want to refine my skills and become
            the best I can be at graphic design my ultimate goal would be to pursue more traditional art forms like painting. Though this doesn't 
            necisarrily limit my passion. It just means that I don't dedicate all my time to it.

        <h2>Excersize</h2>
        <p>
        Every single day, or almost every single day, I make my way to the rec center for the soul purpose of bettering myself physically. 
        I compete in powerlifting and I plan on competing in Nationals in the USAPL, a popular american powerlifting association, wher I hope to be
        a contender for a podium position. However things like school and my time I spend painting take priority a lot of the time. I also don't see 
        it as a possible career path and it definitley constitutes as a hobby in my mind.

        <h2>Movies</h2>
        <p>
        My most recent addition to my stack of hobbies is watching movies. I never really considered taking the time to intentionally watch a movie for 
        any other purpose than being bored and needing long form content stimulation. I saw it as a way to give my mind a break. Then my brother started showing
        me some of his favorite movies and I was immediatley hooked. Once I watched interstellar, like really payed attention and looked for value in it, I found movies 
        were more than just a cure for boredom. I have decided that once a week I will watch a new movie till I have watched all of the "greatest movies".
