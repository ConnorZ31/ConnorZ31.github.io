    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div>
        <p>I am a Colorado Native, born and raised in Denver and currently live in Boulder. I am an artist, I lived in Hawai’i for a couple of years, I am also a competitive powerlifter and dabble in painting warhammer.

    <h3>Interests</h3>
    <div> 
        <p>My passion in life has always been making art. Specifically painting, though I mainly draw now. I also love to pick up new skills, that’s why I chose the CTD route. I work out 5 days a week. I play a lot of video games, mainly Call of Duty and a lot of Lego games. I watch at least one movie a week, most of the time 3-4. I watched Se7en most recently. I also try to work on my warhammer at least once a week. I don’t have an army yet, I just like to paint them.

    <h4> Goals</h4>
    <div> 
        <p>My goals right now are a bit scattered, really all I want to do is graduate. What I do for work doesn’t really matter to me as long as it’s something creative and I can get my hands on it in some way, even if that means some form of programming, I just want to take part in making something. Other miscellaneous goals that I have would be taking my art to the next level and not having it just be a hobby anymore, making it to nationals for powerlifting, and finishing all of the minis(warhammer figures) that I own by the end of the year.
